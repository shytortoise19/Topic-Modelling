# Topic-Modelling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of topics.

## Features
- Load and preprocess textual data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Apply LDA for topic modeling
- Visualize topics using `pyLDAvis`

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyLDAvis pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Copy_of_Topic_modeling.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load data
   - Perform EDA
   - Train the LDA model
   - Visualize the topics

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- pyLDAvis

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of a topic modeling study. It includes common preprocessing techniques and visualization methods for topic modeling using LDA.
